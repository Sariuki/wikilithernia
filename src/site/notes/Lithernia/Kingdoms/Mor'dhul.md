# Mor'dhul

Mor'dhul,  the kingdom of death and shadow,  is a land where darkness reigns supreme.  Ruled by the [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Korogrim Pantheon\|Korogrim Pantheon]],  a family of gods who embrace chaos and destruction,  Mor'dhul is a place of harsh landscapes,  brutal customs,  and a constant struggle for power.  Its inhabitants—[[Lithernia/Races/Tieflings\|Tieflings]],  [[Lithernia/Races/Orcs\|Orcs]],  [[Lithernia/Races/Half-Ogres\|Half-Ogres]],  [[Lithernia/Races/Hobgoblins\|Hobgoblins]],  and [[Lithernia/Races/Goblins\|Goblins]]—are known for their ferocity,  their cunning,  and their unwavering loyalty to their cruel deities.  Mor'dhul is a land of secrets and shadows,  where the whispers of the dead mingle with the clash of steel and the cries of the tortured.
