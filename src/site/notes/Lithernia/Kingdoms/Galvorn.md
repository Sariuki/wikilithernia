# Galvorn

Galvorn, a maritime kingdom of freedom and exploration,  stands as a beacon of hope amidst the turmoil of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].  Ruled by the [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Galvorn/Human Pantheon\|Human Pantheon]],  who embody the power of the sea and sky,  Galvorn is a land of bustling ports,  daring explorers,  and shrewd merchants.  Its people—[[Lithernia/Races/Humans\|Humans]],  [[Lithernia/Races/Halflings\|Halflings]],  Genasi,  and others—value independence,  adventure,  and the pursuit of knowledge.  Galvorn's ships sail the vast oceans,  seeking new lands,  trading goods,  and spreading the spirit of freedom to the far corners of the world.
