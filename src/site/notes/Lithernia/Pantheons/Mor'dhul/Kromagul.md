## Overview

Kromagul, the God of Pain, is a being of pure sadism and cruelty within the [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Korogrim Pantheon\|Korogrim Pantheon]]. He embodies the agonizing depths of suffering, the torment of both body and mind, and the chilling whisper of fear that accompanies pain.  Revered (or perhaps more accurately, *dreaded*) by the [[Lithernia/Races/Hobgoblins\|Hobgoblins]] of [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]], Kromagul revels in the agony of others, finding perverse pleasure in the breaking of both will and flesh.
