# Korogrim Pantheon

## Overview

The Korogrim Pantheon, the gods of [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]], are a family of deities who embody the darker aspects of existence: death, war, blood, pain, and sacrifice. Known for their volatile relationships, thirst for power, and embrace of chaos and destruction, the Korogrim wield immense influence over the brutal society of [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]].

## Members

* **[[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Thyrgram\|Thyrgram]]**: God of War, a force of pure rage and violence, he revels in bloodshed and the glory of battle.
* **[[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]]**: God of Blood, a being of primal savagery and bloodlust, he seeks to unleash the untamed instincts within mortals.
* **[[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Kromagul\|Kromagul]]**: God of Pain, a master of torture and suffering, he delights in the agony of others and whispers promises of power through pain.
* **[[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Gyth'kai\|Gyth'kai]]**: Goddess of Sacrifice, a manipulator of shadows and blood, she encourages her followers to offer sacrifices to gain power and favor.

## Dynamics

* **Chaotic and Conflict-Ridden**:  The relationships between the Korogrim are marked by intense rivalry, power struggles, and opposing philosophies.

## Conflicts

* **Other Pantheons**: The Korogrim are viewed with fear and distrust by the other pantheons of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]], their chaotic nature a threat to the balance of the world.
* **[[Lithernia/organizations/Order of the Silver Flame\|Order of the Silver Flame]]**: This organization of paladins actively opposes the Korogrim, seeking to eradicate their influence and bring an end to their reign of terror.
* **Mortal Ambition**: The Korogrim are often manipulated by ambitious mortals who seek to gain their favor or steal their power, leading to further conflict and instability. 

## Notes

* The death of [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Sel'thirak\|Sel'thirak]] has disrupted the balance of power within the Korogrim Pantheon, leading to increased instability in [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]].
* The remaining gods are vying for control, creating a dangerous power vacuum that could have devastating consequences for [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].
* [[Lithernia/History/The Prophecy\|The prophecy]] of the First King's return adds another layer of complexity to the situation, as the Korogrim may play a role in either preventing or facilitating his return.
