# Sel'thirak

While feared by many, he is also respected, even revered, by those who seek to understand and control death's power.

## Relationships

* **[[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Korogrim Pantheon\|Korogrim Pantheon]]**:  Sel'thirak is a prominent member of this chaotic family of gods, though his pursuit of order often puts him at odds with his siblings, especially [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]], the God of Blood.
* **[[Lithernia/Races/Tieflings\|Tieflings]]**: [[Lithernia/Races/Tieflings\|Tieflings]] are his favored race, and many revere him as their patron deity.
* **Lord Aethel**: Aethel, the ambitious Tiefling, betrayed and murdered Sel'thirak, marking a turning point in [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]]'s history. 

## Goals

* **Control the Undead**: He seeks to prevent the uncontrolled spread of undeath and the misuse of necromantic magic.

* **[[Lithernia/organizations/Order of the Silver Flame\|Order of the Silver Flame]]**: Sel'thirak's use of necromancy puts him in direct opposition to this organization of paladins who seek to eradicate all forms of evil, including undeath. 
* **Mortal Ambition**: He views those who seek to cheat death or upset the natural order as a threat, as exemplified by his conflict with Lord Aethel.

## Notes

*  His legacy continues to influence Tiefling culture and the practice of necromancy in [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]].
*  The possibility of his resurrection or the emergence of a new champion of death remains a source of intrigue and potential conflict in [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].
