# Orcs

Orcs,  forged by Thyrgram,  God of War,  are a fierce and brutal race,  known for their strength,  their love of battle,  and their unwavering loyalty to their clans.  They are a proud and independent people,  with a strong warrior culture and a deep respect for those who prove their strength in combat.  Orcs are often seen as savage and bloodthirsty,  but they also possess a strong sense of honor and a fierce loyalty to their kin.  They are a force to be reckoned with on the battlefield,  their battle cries echoing across the land as they charge into the fray.
