# Humans

Humans,  created by [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Galvorn/Yfrit\|Yfrit]],  Goddess of the Sea,  are the most diverse and adaptable race in [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].  They are known for their resilience,  their ambition,  and their capacity for both great good and great evil.  Humans have spread across the land,  establishing kingdoms,  building cities,  and exploring the far corners of the world.  They are a race of endless potential,  their destinies shaped by their choices and their actions.
