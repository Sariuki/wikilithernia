# Dark Elves

Dark Elves,  also known as Shadow Elves,  are a cunning and secretive race,  known for their mastery of illusion magic and their affinity for shadows and darkness.  They are often misunderstood and feared by the other races,  but they are not inherently evil.  Dark Elves are driven by a thirst for knowledge and a desire to unravel the mysteries of the world,  even if it means delving into the darkest corners of magic.
