# Dwarves

Dwarves,  created by the Dwarven Pantheon,  are a sturdy and enduring race,  known for their love of craftsmanship,  their deep connection to the earth,  and their strong sense of community.  They are skilled miners,  metalworkers,  and warriors,  and they have a long and rich history of tradition and honor.  Dwarves are often found in mountainous regions,  where they carve out their homes and cities from the heart of the stone.  They are a proud and independent people,  fiercely loyal to their clans and their traditions.
