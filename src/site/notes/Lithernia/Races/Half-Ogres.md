# Half-Ogres

Half-Ogres,  born from the union of ogres and [[Lithernia/Races/Humans\|humans]],  are a race of towering strength and primal fury.  They inherit the immense physical power of their ogre ancestors and the cunning and adaptability of [[Lithernia/Races/Humans\|humans]].  Half-ogres are often feared for their brutal nature and their love of violence,  but they can also be loyal companions and fierce protectors.  They are drawn to battle and revel in the thrill of combat,  their roars shaking the earth as they unleash their primal rage.
