# Half-Orcs

Half-Orcs, born from the union of Orcs and [[Lithernia/Races/Humans\|Humans]], are a race that embodies the strength and ferocity of their Orcish heritage and the adaptability and ambition of their human lineage.  They are often seen as outsiders,  caught between two worlds,  but their unique blend of traits makes them formidable warriors,  skilled survivors,  and cunning strategists.  Half-Orcs are often driven by a desire to prove themselves,  to find their place in a world that doesn't always accept them,  and to forge their own destiny.
