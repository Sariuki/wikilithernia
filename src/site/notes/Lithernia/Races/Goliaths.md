# Goliaths

Goliaths,  created by Trovdor,  God of Metal,  are a strong and hardy race,  known for their resilience,  their love of battle,  and their connection to the mountains.  They are a tall and imposing people,  with a strong sense of community and a deep respect for strength and courage.  Goliaths are often found in mountainous regions,  where they live in close-knit tribes and defend their territories with fierce determination.
