# Tieflings

Tieflings,  created by Sel'thirak,  God of Death,  are a race of humanoids with a legacy of darkness and a natural affinity for magic.  They are known for their cunning,  their manipulative nature,  and their skill in the darker arts.  Their distinctive features—deep midnight skin,  captivating crimson eyes,  and gracefully curved horns—are a mark of their infernal heritage.  Tieflings often walk a path between the worlds of light and shadow,  their choices shaped by their individual desires and the whispers of their infernal bloodline.
