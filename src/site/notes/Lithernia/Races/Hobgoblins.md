# Hobgoblins

Hobgoblins,  created by Kromagul,  God of Pain,  are a cruel and sadistic race,  known for their mastery of torture and their delight in the suffering of others.  They are a disciplined and organized people,  with a rigid social hierarchy and a strict code of conduct.  Hobgoblins are often employed as soldiers,  guards,  and enforcers,  their ruthlessness and efficiency making them formidable opponents.  They believe that pain is a necessary part of life,  a tool for shaping the weak and testing the strong.
