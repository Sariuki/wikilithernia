# Goblins

Goblins,  born from the essence of Gyth'kai,  Goddess of Sacrifice,  are a cunning and chaotic race,  known for their love of trickery,  their devotion to dark rituals,  and their unpredictable nature.  They are a mischievous and often-malicious people,  driven by greed,  curiosity,  and a love of chaos.  Goblins are skilled scavengers and opportunistic raiders,  always looking for a way to gain an advantage,  whether through stealth,  deception,  or sheer overwhelming numbers.
