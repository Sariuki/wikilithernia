# Order of the Broken Chain

## Overview

The Order of the Broken Chain is a clandestine organization operating across all four kingdoms of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]], united in their opposition to the rule of the gods and their desire to liberate mortals from divine influence. They are a diverse group, comprising members of all races and backgrounds, bound by their shared belief in free will and self-determination.

## Leadership

* **The Council of Shadows**: A group of masked individuals who represent the various cells of the Order, meeting in secret locations to coordinate their efforts.

## Beliefs

The Order of the Broken Chain holds these fundamental beliefs:

* **Free Will**: They believe that mortals should be free to determine their own destiny, without interference from the gods.
* **Self-Reliance**: They advocate for self-reliance and independence from divine authority.
* **Equality**: They believe in the equality of all races and oppose any form of divine favoritism or discrimination.

## Goals

The Order seeks to:

* **Undermine Divine Authority**: They aim to expose the gods' manipulations and weaken their influence over mortals.
* **Spread Anti-Theist Ideologies**: They seek to educate others about the dangers of blind faith and promote critical thinking about the nature of the divine.
* **Ultimately**: Some within the Order dream of a world where mortals are free to govern themselves without the interference of gods.

## Methods

* **Subversion and Sabotage**: They disrupt religious institutions, expose corrupt practices, and sow discord among the faithful.
* **Propaganda and Education**: They spread their message through pamphlets, coded messages, and secret gatherings.
* **Direct Action**: Some cells employ more aggressive tactics, targeting religious figures or symbols of divine power.

## Conflicts

* **Religious Institutions**: They are in direct opposition to the established religions of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] and their hierarchies.
* **Governments Aligned with Gods**: They often clash with authorities who enforce divine laws or support the rule of the gods.
* **Internal Divisions**: The diversity of the Order can lead to disagreements over tactics and goals.

## Notes

* The Order is shrouded in secrecy, its members using aliases and masks to protect their identities.
* They are viewed as heretics and rebels by the religious authorities.
* Their influence is growing, especially among those who have lost faith in the gods or who have suffered under their rule.
