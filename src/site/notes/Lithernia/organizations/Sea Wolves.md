# Sea Wolves

## Overview

The Sea Wolves are a notorious band of pirates who roam the seas of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]], primarily operating around [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Galvorn\|Galvorn]]. Feared for their ruthlessness and skill in naval combat, they are loyal to no king or god, seeking only plunder, treasure, and freedom on the open waves.

## Leadership

* **Captain "Irontooth" Grimgar**:  A brutal and cunning [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Monsters/Orc\|Orc]], commanding the Sea Wolves with an iron fist.

## Beliefs

The Sea Wolves have a simple code:

* **Freedom**:  They value their independence above all else.
* **Plunder**: They believe in taking what they want through force.
* **Loyalty to the Crew**:  They are bound by a fierce loyalty to their fellow pirates.

## Goals

The Sea Wolves' goals are straightforward:

* **Amass Treasure**: They raid ships and coastal settlements for wealth and valuables.
* **Spread Fear**: They enjoy terrorizing those who sail the seas.
* **Live by Their Own Rules**: They reject the laws of the kingdoms and live according to their own pirate code.

## Methods

* **Naval Warfare**: They are skilled sailors and adept at ship-to-ship combat.
* **Boarding Actions**: They use brutal tactics to overpower and plunder ships.
* **Raids and Plunder**: They attack coastal towns and villages, taking what they can.

## Conflicts

The Sea Wolves are at odds with:

* **[[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Galvorn\|Galvorn]]'s Navy**: They are constantly hunted by the kingdom's warships.
* **Merchants and Traders**:  They target merchant ships and disrupt trade routes.
* **Coastal Communities**: They raid and plunder coastal settlements, causing fear and destruction.

## Notes

*  The Sea Wolves are a constant threat to maritime trade and security.
*  They have a hidden base on a remote island, where they store their loot.
*  Captain Grimgar's leadership and ambition make the Sea Wolves a particularly dangerous pirate crew.
