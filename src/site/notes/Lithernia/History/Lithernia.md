# Lithernia

Lithernia is a world steeped in ancient magic, where the echoes of a fallen king and the clash of powerful deities resonate through the ages. Once a unified realm, Lithernia is now fractured, divided into four distinct kingdoms: [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]], a land of shadows and death; [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Galvorn\|Galvorn]], a maritime kingdom embracing freedom and exploration; [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Valtoria\|Valtoria]], a mountainous realm of dwarven strength and craftsmanship; and [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Eldrador\|Eldrador]], an ancient elven kingdom where magic and nature intertwine. The land is scarred by [[Lithernia/History/The Great War\|the Great War]], a conflict fueled by the ambitions of the gods and the legacy of the First King, a ruler who dared to challenge the divine order. A prophecy whispers of the First King's return, a promise of change that could either unite Lithernia or plunge it into an even deeper darkness.
