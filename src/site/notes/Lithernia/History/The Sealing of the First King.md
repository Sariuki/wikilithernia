# The Sealing of the First King

In the dawn of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]]'s history, a powerful and charismatic ruler known as the First King rose to power. He united the human settlements, bringing order and prosperity to the land. But his ambition was boundless,  and he sought to ascend to godhood,  believing he could forge a better future for his people by claiming divine power. This act of hubris angered the gods, who waged a devastating war against him.  The First King,  despite his might,  was ultimately defeated and sealed away by the gods,  imprisoned with the power of four celestial lances: Requiem, Ultimatum, Mortum, and Chronos. His legacy,  however,  lives on in whispers and prophecies,  foretelling a day when he will return to reshape the destiny of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].
