# The Great War

The Great War is a conflict that has raged across [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] for millennia, a testament to the enduring power of ambition,  hatred,  and the struggle for dominance.  Fueled by the gods' own ambitions and the inherent flaws of the races they created,  the Great War has divided [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] into four warring kingdoms:  [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul]],  [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Galvorn\|Galvorn]],  [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Valtoria\|Valtoria]],  and [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Eldrador\|Eldrador]].  Each kingdom believes it is destined to rule,  and the conflict has left a trail of bloodshed,  destruction,  and unhealed wounds across the land.  The Great War is a constant shadow over [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]],  a reminder of the fragility of peace and the enduring power of conflict.
