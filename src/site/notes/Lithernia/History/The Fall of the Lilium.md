# The Fall of the Lilium

The Fall of the Lilium was a cataclysmic event that forever scarred the world of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]]. Enraged by the First King's defiance and the devastation caused by his war, the gods unleashed a devastating fire known as the Lilium.  This celestial inferno swept across the land,  consuming everything in its path. The Lilium reshaped continents,  shattered mountains,  and extinguished entire civilizations. It was a cleansing fire,  a divine judgment that wiped away the old world and ushered in a new era,  one marked by the rise of the diverse races of [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].
