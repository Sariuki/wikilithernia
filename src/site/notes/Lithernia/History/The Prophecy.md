# The Prophecy

An ancient prophecy, whispered through generations, foretells the return of the First King, the once-great ruler who was sealed away by the gods.  It is said that a chosen hero will rise,  wielding the First King's power and the four celestial lances that bind him. This hero will challenge the gods themselves,  either to restore balance to [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] or to usher in a new age of darkness.  The prophecy is a source of both hope and fear,  a reminder of the cyclical nature of power and the potential for both destruction and renewal.
