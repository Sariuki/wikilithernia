# Mana Dice in [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]]

Each spellcasting class in [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] has a specific Mana Die that represents their natural capacity to channel and manipulate magical energy. This die is used to determine mana fatigue damage and the effectiveness of certain magical [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Gameplay/Abilities\|abilities]], such as spell mixing and enhancement. 

Here's a table of Mana Dice for each class:

| Class      | Mana Die |
|------------|----------|
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Wizard\|Wizard]]     | 1d6      |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]   | 1d8      |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Warlock\|Warlock]]    | 1d10     |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Cleric\|Cleric]]     | 1d8      |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Druid\|Druid]]      | 1d8      |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Bard\|Bard]]       | 1d6      |

**Using Mana Dice:**

* **Mana Fatigue:** When a character casts a spell, they roll their Mana Die and add the spell's level to determine the mana fatigue damage they suffer. 
* **Spell Mixing and Enhancement:** The result of the Mana Die is used to determine the Difficulty Class (DC) for Mana Channeling checks when mixing or enhancing spells. 

**Example:**

A [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Sorcerer\|sorcerer]] casts a level 2 spell. They roll their Mana Die (1d8) and get a 6. They suffer 8 points of mana fatigue damage (6 + 2).

**Remember:**

* The Mana Die is a key element of the [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] magic system, reflecting the different magical capabilities of each class.
* DMs can adjust the Mana Dice for certain classes or subclasses to create a more customized and balanced magic system.
