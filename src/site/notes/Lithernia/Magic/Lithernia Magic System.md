# [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] Magic System: Weaving the Threads of Fate

[[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]], a world born of fire and shadow, vibrates with a palpable magical energy: Mana. This flow of ancestral power connects all living beings, the elements, and the [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Gamemastering/Planes\|planes]] of existence. Mages, through rigorous study and constant practice, learn to perceive and manipulate Mana, shaping their spells and weaving the threads of fate.

## Fundamental Principles:

* **The Mana Weave:** [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]] is enveloped in an invisible network of Mana, a magical energy that connects all living things and the elements of the world. Mages can perceive this weave, seeing it as a constant flow of energy that courses through the world.

* **Circles of Invocation:** Circles of invocation are complex geometric patterns that mages use to amplify and modify their spells. They represent a mage's mastery of their art and allow them to reach higher levels of power.

## Circles of Invocation (Details):

* **Function:** Circles do not directly channel mana, but rather modify the existing magical flow, allowing the mage to refine and specialize their spells.

* **Types:**
    * **Lesser Circles (Level 1):** Drawn in minutes, they enhance level 1 spells.
    * **Intermediate Circles (Level 5):** More complex, requiring an hour to draw, they enhance level 2 and 3 spells.
    * **Greater Circles (Level 11):** Extremely complex, requiring at least 4 hours to complete, they enhance level 4 and higher spells.

* **Effects:**
    * Increase damage.
    * Extend duration.
    * Expand the area of effect.
    * Add additional effects to the spell (determined by the DM).

## Channeling Mana:

* Mages channel mana through their bodies, using it to shape their spells.
* The amount of mana a mage can channel depends on their training, class, and level.

## Mana Fatigue:

* Each time a character casts a spell, they suffer mana fatigue damage.
* **Calculation:** (Class Mana Die) + (Spell Level).
* **Extreme Fatigue:** (Mana Fatigue Damage ≥ (Maximum Mana Points / 2)) => Suffer one level of exhaustion.
* **Loss of Consciousness:** (Mana Fatigue Damage ≥ Current Mana Points) => Becomes unconscious.

## Mana Regeneration:

* **Long Rest:** Recovers all mana points. (8 hours of sleep)
* **Short Rest:** Roll all their mana dice and add the result to their current mana points. (1 hour)
* **Meditation:** Recovers mana points; the amount varies depending on the time spent and the character's Mana Channeling skill.
* **Magic Potions:** Restore mana points. (Rarity and cost depend on the amount of mana restored).
* **Places of Power:** Areas with a high concentration of mana that allow mages to regenerate mana more quickly.

## Absorbing Mana:

* Characters can attempt to absorb mana from external sources (places of power, magical creatures, artifacts).
* **Skill Check:** Mana Channeling (DC determined by the DM based on the potency of the source).
* **Success:** Recovers (Die according to the level of the source) + (Level of the source) + (Mana Channeling modifier).
* **Failure:** Does not recover mana and may suffer 1 point of magical fatigue damage.
