# Spell Enhancement in [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]]

Spell enhancement is a technique that allows mages to amplify the power of their spells by using circles of invocation. These circles, drawn with precision and infused with mana, can modify the flow of magical energy,  enhancing the effects of a spell.

## Rules of Spell Enhancement:

* **Circle of Invocation:** The mage must have prepared a circle of invocation of the appropriate level for the spell being enhanced. 
* **Skill Check:** The mage must make a Mana Channeling skill check. 
* **DC of the Check:** 12 + (Spell Level x Mana Die Result)
* **Effects of Enhancement:**
    * **Success:** The spell is amplified with the effects of the circle.  The DM will determine the specific enhancements based on the type of circle used and the nature of the spell.  Possible enhancements include increased damage,  extended duration,  expanded area of effect,  or additional effects.
    * **Failure:** The spell is cast normally, without the enhancement of the circle.

**Example:**

A [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Wizard\|wizard]] wants to enhance a [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fireball\|Fireball]] spell (Level 3) using an Intermediate Circle of Invocation. They roll their Mana Die (1d6) and get a 5. The DC for their Mana Channeling check is 12 + (3 x 5) = 27. If they succeed on the check, the [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fireball\|Fireball]] will be enhanced, perhaps dealing additional damage or having a larger area of effect. If they fail, the [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fireball\|Fireball]] is cast normally.

**Remember:**

* Spell enhancement allows mages to push the boundaries of their magical [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Gameplay/Abilities\|abilities]].
* DMs should work with players to determine the specific effects of spell enhancement, ensuring that it remains balanced and engaging.
