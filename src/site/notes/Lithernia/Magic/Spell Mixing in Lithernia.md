# Spell Mixing in [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]]

Spell mixing is a complex and powerful technique that allows experienced mages to combine two spells into a single, more potent and unique effect.  This requires a high level of skill in Mana Channeling and a deep understanding of the interplay between different magical energies. 

## Rules of Spell Mixing:

* **Skill Check:** The mage must make a Mana Channeling skill check. The DC of the check is determined by the class of the mage and the level of the spells being mixed.

| Class                  | Spells that can be mixed                                    | DC of the Check                               |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Warlock\|Warlock]]               | Two Cantrips                                                | 10 + Character Level                          |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Sorcerer\|Sorcerer]]              | One Cantrip + one Spell that costs Mana                      | 12 + Spell Level                             |
| [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Wizard\|Wizard]], [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Cleric\|Cleric]], [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Druid\|Druid]], [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Classes/Bard\|Bard]] | Two Spells that cost Mana                                 | 15 + Level of the highest level spell |

* **Effects of Mixing:**
    * **Success:**  A combined spell with unique effects is created. The DM will describe the specific effects of the mixed spell, taking into account the properties of the original spells and the creativity of the player.
    * **Failure:** The spell fails, produces no effects, and the caster suffers the mana fatigue damage of both spells.

## Examples of Spell Mixing:

* **Freezing [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fireball\|Fireball]]:** A mage could mix the spells "[[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fireball\|Fireball]]" and "[[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Ray of Frost\|Ray of Frost]]" to create a [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fireball\|fireball]] that explodes in a burst of frost, freezing enemies.
* **Star-Guided Arrow:** An archer could mix a "[[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Guidance\|Guidance]]" spell with an arrow shot so that the arrow follows its target even if it moves.
* **Earth and [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Fire Shield\|Fire Shield]]:** A warrior could mix a "[[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Shield\|Shield]]" spell with a "[[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Spells/Barkskin\|Barkskin]]" spell to create a shield resistant to fire and physical attacks.

**Remember:**

* Spell mixing is a powerful tool that can allow players to create unique and devastating effects.
* DMs should carefully consider the potential consequences of spell mixing and work with players to create balanced and interesting results.
