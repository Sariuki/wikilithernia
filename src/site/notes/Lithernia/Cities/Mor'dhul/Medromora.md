# Medromora

## Overview

Medromora, a city built on the slopes of an active volcano, is a brutal and unforgiving place, a testament to the Half-Ogre's love of violence, blood, and the raw power of the earth. The air is thick with the scent of sulfur and the metallic tang of blood, and the ground trembles with the volcano's constant rumblings.  Medromora is a city where strength is revered, weakness is despised, and blood sacrifices are offered to appease the savage God of Blood, [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]].

## Physical Description

* **Architecture**:  Medromora's buildings are constructed from dark volcanic rock, their rough-hewn surfaces stained with ash and blood. Towers and fortifications rise precariously from the volcano's slopes, their foundations trembling with every eruption.  The city's streets are often slick with blood, the result of ritual sacrifices and brutal conflicts.
* **Atmosphere**: The air is heavy with the oppressive heat of the volcano and the stench of sulfur. The constant rumble of the volcano creates an unsettling atmosphere, and the screams of sacrificial victims echo through the city's streets. 
* **Layout**:  The city is built in a series of terraces that climb the volcano's slopes, connected by narrow, winding streets and precarious bridges. The lower levels are home to the city's forges, where [[Lithernia/Races/Half-Ogres\|Half-Ogres]] use the volcano's heat to forge [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Equipment/Weapons\|weapons]] and armor of exceptional strength. The upper levels are occupied by the most powerful Half-Ogre warlords and their clans, their fortresses overlooking the city and the surrounding volcanic landscape.

## Culture and Society

* **Blood Worship**: The influence of [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]], the God of Blood, is pervasive in Medromora. Blood is seen as a source of power, and sacrifices are regularly conducted to appease the god and to fuel the city's dark magic. 
* **Strength and Brutality**: Half-Ogre society values strength, ferocity, and brutality above all else. Those who are weak or show mercy are despised, and conflicts are often settled through bloody [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Gameplay/Combat\|combat]]. 
* **Clan Rivalries**:  The city is divided into numerous Half-Ogre clans, each vying for power and control. Clan rivalries often erupt into violence, and the streets of Medromora are frequently stained with the blood of these conflicts.
* **Survival of the Fittest**: Life in Medromora is harsh and unforgiving, and its inhabitants have learned to survive by embracing their primal instincts and fighting for what they want. There is little room for compassion or weakness in this brutal society. 

## Key Locations

* **Volcano's Crater**: The active volcano that dominates Medromora is a source of both power and danger. [[Lithernia/Races/Half-Ogres\|Half-Ogres]] use its heat to fuel their forges and perform their rituals, but they also live in constant fear of its eruptions.
* **Bloodforge**: The largest and most important forge in Medromora, where master smiths create [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Equipment/Weapons\|weapons]] and [[DND.SRD.Wiki-master/Equipment/Armor\|armor]] of exceptional quality, using the blood of sacrifices to enhance their creations.
* **Temple of [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]]**:  A massive temple dedicated to [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]], built on the highest terrace of the city. Here, Half-Ogre priests conduct blood rituals, offer sacrifices, and commune with their savage god. 

## Important Factions

* **Clan [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]]**:  The most powerful clan in Medromora, they control the Bloodforge and have a strong influence over the city's religious practices. 
* **The Blood Guard**:  The elite warriors of Medromora, they are responsible for defending the city and enforcing the will of the warlords.
* **The Blood Mages**: A group of Half-Ogre sorcerers who specialize in blood magic, using the life force of their victims to fuel their spells.

## Notable Figures

* **Gorga "The Bloody"**: A fierce and powerful Half-Ogre warlord, she is a leader within Clan [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]] and a feared warrior. She is known for her brutality, her thirst for blood, and her unwavering dedication to [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]].
* **Karg "The Ripping"**:  A savage and unpredictable Half-Ogre warrior, he is known for his strength, his ferocity, and his tendency to tear his enemies limb from limb. 
* **Morg "The Hunter"**: A skilled and cunning Half-Ogre hunter, he is an expert tracker and a master of survival in the harsh volcanic landscape. He is often employed by the warlords to track down enemies or to hunt down dangerous creatures.

## Notes

* Medromora is a city of constant danger and violence, a place where only the strong survive. 
* The city's connection to [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]] makes it a breeding ground for dark magic and brutal practices.
* The influence of Medromora is likely to grow in the wake of [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Sel'thirak\|Sel'thirak]]'s death, as the [[Lithernia/Races/Half-Ogres\|Half-Ogres]] seek to fill the power vacuum and assert their dominance in [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]].
