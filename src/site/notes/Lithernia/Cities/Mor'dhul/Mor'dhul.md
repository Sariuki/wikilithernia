# Mor'dhul

## Overview

[[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]], the capital city of the Kingdom of [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]], is a sprawling metropolis of obsidian and shadow, a testament to the kingdom's embrace of death, power, and the darker aspects of existence. Dominated by Tiefling nobility, the city is a place of intrigue, cruelty, and a rigid hierarchy where power is ruthlessly pursued and maintained.  

## Physical Description

* **Architecture**: Buildings are constructed primarily from black obsidian, giving the city a dark and imposing appearance. Spires pierce the perpetually overcast sky, casting long shadows that twist and turn through the narrow, winding streets. Gargoyles and statues of skeletal warriors adorn rooftops and archways, leering down at the city's inhabitants.
* **Atmosphere**:  A palpable sense of dread and oppression hangs over the city. The air is thick with the scent of incense, decay, and the faint metallic tang of blood. Whispers of conspiracy and plots swirl through the shadows, and the sound of screams often echoes from hidden alleyways. 
* **Layout**: The city is a labyrinth of narrow, winding streets, interconnected by bridges and tunnels. The wealthy Tiefling nobility occupies the upper levels of the city, while the lower levels are home to a teeming mass of [[Lithernia/Races/Orcs\|Orcs]], [[Lithernia/Races/Hobgoblins\|Hobgoblins]], [[Lithernia/Races/Goblins\|Goblins]], and other races, all vying for survival in the city's harsh underbelly. 

## Culture and Society

* **Hierarchy**:  [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]] is a rigidly hierarchical society, with the Tiefling nobility ruling over the other races with an iron fist. Power is prized above all else, and those who are weak or lack ambition are quickly crushed. 
* **Death Worship**:  The influence of [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Sel'thirak\|Sel'thirak]], the former God of Death, is pervasive, and death is seen as a natural part of life, even a source of power. Necromancy is practiced openly, and the dead are often seen as resources to be exploited.
* **Intrigue and Betrayal**:  Political machinations and backstabbing are commonplace in [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]]. Trust is a rare commodity, and those who seek power must be constantly vigilant against their rivals. 
* **Entertainment**:  Despite (or perhaps because of) its dark nature, [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]] offers a variety of gruesome entertainments, including gladiatorial combat, public executions, and performances that involve blood magic and necromancy.

## Key Locations

* **The Palace of Obsidian (Ruined)**: This sprawling fortress of black obsidian was once the seat of [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Sel'thirak\|Sel'thirak]]'s power. Now, after his death, it lies in ruins, a symbol of the shifting power dynamics in [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]].
* **The Bone Market**:  A sprawling marketplace where one can find almost anything, from exotic spices and stolen goods to rare poisons and necromantic components. 
* **The Obsidian Obelisk**:  A towering obelisk of black obsidian in the city center, where public executions and blood sacrifices are conducted.
* **The Catacombs**: A vast network of underground tunnels and chambers beneath the city, used for burials, necromantic rituals, and as a hiding place for those seeking to escape the city's watchful eyes.

## Important Factions

* **Clan [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Sel'thirak\|Sel'thirak]] (Weakened)**: Once the dominant force in [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]], this Tiefling clan has been severely weakened by the death of their patron deity. They are struggling to maintain their grip on power, facing challenges from both within and outside the clan. 
* **House Aethel (Ascendant)**: This ambitious Tiefling house, led by Lord Aethel, is quickly rising to power, having assassinated [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Sel'thirak\|Sel'thirak]] and seizing control of the Mortum lance. They represent a new era of ruthlessness and ambition in [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]].
* **[[Lithernia/organizations/Bloodsworn\|Bloodsworn]]**: This fanatical cult dedicated to [[Lithernia/Pantheons/Mor'dhul/Lakros\|Lakros]] is gaining influence in the city, conducting blood rituals and spreading chaos and fear.
* **[[Lithernia/organizations/Shadow Syndicate\|Shadow Syndicate]]**: This secretive organization of thieves, assassins, and spies operates in the shadows, manipulating events and profiting from the city's unrest.

## Notable Figures

* **Lord Aethel**: The self-proclaimed ruler of [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]], he is a ruthless and ambitious Tiefling who wields the power of the Mortum lance. He seeks to reshape [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]] in his image and extend his influence across [[Lithernia/History/Lithernia\|Lithernia/History/Lithernia]].
* **Lady Xandria "The Whisperer"**:  A powerful Tiefling sorceress and a master manipulator, her true allegiances are shrouded in mystery. She is a key player in the city's power struggles, her whispers shaping the destinies of those around her. 
* **Lord Volrath "The Black Hand"**:  A formidable Orcish general, he is caught between his loyalty to the old order and the rise of Lord Aethel. His decisions could have a profound impact on the future of [[Lithernia/Cities/Mor'dhul/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]]. 

## Notes

* The city is a dangerous place for outsiders, as the streets are filled with danger, and trust is a rare commodity.
