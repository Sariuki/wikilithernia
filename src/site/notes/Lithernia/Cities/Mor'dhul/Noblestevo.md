## Overview

Noblestevo, a city carved into the caldera of a dormant volcano, is a testament to the Orcish love of battle, fire, and the raw power of metal. A bustling hub of Orcish culture, the city serves as a training ground for warriors, a center of metalworking and weaponsmithing, and a stronghold of Orcish power within [[Lithernia/Kingdoms/Mor'dhul\|Mor'dhul]].

* The city is a dangerous place for outsiders, as its inhabitants are quick to resort to violence, and the competition between Orcish clans can erupt into bloody conflicts.
